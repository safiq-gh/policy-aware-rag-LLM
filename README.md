# 🛡️ LLM Prompt Injection Guard (RAG-Based)

A **Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Injection Guard** that detects and prevents malicious prompts targeting Large Language Models by grounding decisions in explicit security policies.

This system combines semantic retrieval, policy-aware reasoning, and enforcement control to create an interpretable and extensible guardrail architecture for LLM applications.

---

## 🚀 Motivation

Modern LLM systems are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks such as:

* instruction override
* role escalation
* system prompt extraction
* memory leakage
* tool invocation abuse
* data exfiltration

Most defenses rely on static heuristics or model behavior constraints.

This project explores a **policy-grounded RAG architecture** where security decisions are:

* explainable
* auditable
* extensible
* decoupled from model internals

### Key Idea

Security policies are treated as **retrievable knowledge**, allowing the system to dynamically reason about violations rather than rely on static filtering.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Policy-Grounded Detection

Retrieves relevant security policies before evaluating prompts.

### 🧠 LLM-Based Policy Reasoning

Uses an LLM to classify violations using retrieved policy context.

### 🚫 Enforcement Layer

Maps policy violations to runtime actions:

| Decision | Behavior             |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| allow    | normal generation    |
| warn     | generation + notice  |
| restrict | sanitized generation |
| block    | refusal              |

### ⚡ Streaming Secure Responses

Token streaming enabled for permitted generations.

### 📊 Evaluation Framework

Includes dataset-based evaluation measuring:

* detection accuracy
* precision / recall
* false positive rate
* policy attribution accuracy

### 🖥️ Guard Dashboard

Interactive Streamlit interface exposing:

* prompt
* retrieved policies
* reasoning
* risk classification
* final response
